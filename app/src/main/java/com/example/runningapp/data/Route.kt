 * of times or never. That is why deleting one touches nothing else — there is no key from here into
 * `sessions` and none from `sessions` into here, so the library can be emptied without a single Run
 * being disturbed.
 *
 * [distanceMeters] and [elevationGainMeters] are worked out once, at import, and banked — unlike a
 * Run's numbers, which are re-measured off the stored track every time its page is opened, so a
 * change to how the app measures reaches history. A Run can be re-measured because a Run keeps its
 * evidence; an imported Route's heights are bare numbers from a file that is already gone, and no
 * better rule could ever be applied to them
 * ([ADR 0014](../../../../../../../docs/adr/0014-a-route-is-a-plan-not-a-recording.md)).
